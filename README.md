## Description

Enter your age and this application will let you know what your age is based on the solar years of four different planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, & Jupiter.

The app will let you know how long you would be expected to live on the other planets based on the global average estimated by the United Nations at 72 years. If you have surpassed the estimate it will tell you how long you've lived past it.
